    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying
    between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other
    scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well-thumbed copy of <cite>On the Road</cite>.
    It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls
    the more she felt she needed to be free. </p>
    <p>She had spent the last 10 years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar
    Wilde quote <q cite="Oscar Wilde">Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better
    to do</q>. Although many conisdered her pioneering work, untravelling the secrets of
      llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement,
      Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
